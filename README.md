# Data_Contracts
Repo for data contracts

## Data Contracts

The Data Contracts are all stored in the *DATA_CONTRACTS* folder. There is one folder for each data contract. Inside each folder is a *.md* file and a *.yaml* file. The *.yaml* file is the actual Data Contract, and should be kept up to date regularly. The *.md* file is meant to walk you through the contract if you are unfamiliar with it. 
### When adding new information to a Contract or updating it, make sure to make those changes to the .yaml file.

## Automation

The automation folder stores different Python programs with the purpose of automating the data contracts. 
It has its own README file to explain how to use those automation files.

## Templates

There are templates for the Data Contracts in the Templates folder. They are now out of date, and the automation process will actually create a more updated template. The templates are just around to show where this all came from I guess...

## Interactive Format

The Interactive Format folder is just around to show a little example of these data contracts created in a more readable way. Might go back and implement this style after finishing all four of the data contracts. You can probably just ignore that for now, unless you really don't want to.
